Initially, our implementation consists of a single module, easytext. With this starting point, there is no
separation of concerns. There’s just a single package inside a module, which by now we are familiar
with, as shown in Example 3-2.

Example 3-2. EasyText as single module (➥ chapter3/easytext-singlemodule)
src
└── easytext
    ├── javamodularity
    │   └── easytext
    │       └── Main.java
    └── module-info.java

The module descriptor is an empty one. The Main class reads a file, applies a single readability formula
(Flesch-Kincaid) and prints the results to the console. After compiling and packaging the module, it works
like this: 

$ java --module-path mods -m easytext input.txt 
Reading input.txt 
Flesh-Kincaid:83.42468299865723

Obviously, the single-module setup ticks none of the boxes as far as our requirements are concerned. It’s
time to add more modules into the mix.
